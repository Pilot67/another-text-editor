## Usage
The editor is fully functioning once the browser page loads. Any data in the editor is saved the the browser database when the editor looses focus.  

The install button will appear on the left side of the nav bar once the app has finished loading.  
You can install the app by clicking on the install button (If your browser allows this functionality). This will install an icon on your desktop of in you app repository.
